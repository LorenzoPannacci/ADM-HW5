    "### Graphs setup \n",
    "Based on the available data, you will create two graphs to model our relationships as follows: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. __Citation graph__: This graph should represent the paper's citation relationships. We want this graph to be unweighted and directed. The citation should represent the citation given from one paper to another. For example, if paper A has cited paper B, we should expect an edge from node A to B.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Collaboration graph__: This graph should represent the collaborations of the paper's authors. This graph should be weighted and undirected. Consider an appropriate weighting scheme for your edges to make your graph weighted.\n",

    "### Data pre-processing \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is quite large and may not fit in your memory when you try constructing your graph. So, what is the solution? You should focus your investigation on a subgraph. You can work on the most connected component in the graph. However, you must first construct and analyze the connections to identify the connected components. \n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, you will attempt to approximate that most connected component by performing the following steps: \n",
    "1. Identify the __top 10,000__ papers with the <ins>highest number of citations</ins>.\n",
    "2. Then the __nodes__ of your graphs would be as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "   __Citation graph__: you can consider each of the papers as your nodes\n",
    "\n",
    "   __Collaboration graph__: the authors of these papers would be your nodes\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. For the __edges__ of the two graphs, you would have the following cases:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __Citation graph__: only consider the citation relationship between these 10,000 papers and ignore the rest.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   __Collaboration graph__: only consider the collaborations between the authors of these 10,000 papers and ignore the rest. "

    "Input: \n",
    "- The graph\n",

    "- Whether the graph is dense or sparse\n",

    "### Functionality 2 - Nodes' contribution \n",
    "Using this functionality, you will identify the papers/authors who have significantly contributed to this field of study. For this analysis, focusing solely on the number of citations for the paper or the number of collaborations of the authors can be misleading. You will examine this using various centrality measurements. \n",

The choice of a\\_j and a\\_n can be made randomly (or if it improves the performance of the algorithm, you can also define it in any other way) \n",
    "\n",
    "__Important Notes:__\n",
    "- This algorithm should be run only on the collaboration graph.\n",
    "- The algorithm needs to handle the case that the graph is not connected. Thus, only some nodes in _a_ are reachable from a\\_1. In such a scenario, it is enough to let the program give in the output the string \"There is no such path.\"\n",
    "- Since we are dealing with walks, you can pass on the same node _a\\_i_ more than once, but you must preserve order. It means you can go back to any author node any time you want, assuming that the order in which you visit the required nodes is still the same.\n",
