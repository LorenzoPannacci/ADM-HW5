This repository contains the submission of Group #11 of the fifth homework for the course "Algorithmic Methods of Data Mining", Academic year 2023â€“2024.

Here we provide the link for an easier access to the notebook: https://nbviewer.org/github/LorenzoPannacci/ADM-HW5/blob/main/main.ipynb

## Contents

* __`main.ipynb`__: the main notebook files. It contains all the answers and all the cells are already executed
* __`functions/`__: a folder containing all the relevant functions used in the notebook divided into modules
  * `functionality.py`: a python file containing the funcionalities requested in the backend section of part 2
  * `visualization.py`: a python file containing the visualizations requested in the frontend section of part 2
  * `bonus.py`: a python file containing the functions used for the bonus question
* __`scripts/`__: a folder containing some scripts used in the main notebook
  * `bash_script.sh`: is used in data preprocessing (RQ1). In prticular, it splits the original database in smaller files. To be used it has to be moved in the same folder has the original .json file downloaded from Kaggle
  * `savecsv.py`: this script converts the citation graph file to a CSV adjacency matrix
  * `clq.py`: this script applies BFS to evaluate the average shortest path in the citation graph
* __`graphs/`__: is a folder containing the `citation graph` and the `collaboration graph` in the .pickle format, permitting to save a networkx graphs as files and load it later without have to compute them again
* __`images/`__:  is a folder containing three images, one for each question of the CLQ
* __`input/`__:  is a folder containing two .txt files with the input examples for the Algorithm Question
* __`CommandLine.sh`__: a bash script that solves the CLQ question
